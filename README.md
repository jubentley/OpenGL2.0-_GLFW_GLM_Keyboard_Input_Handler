# OpenGL2.0+_GLFW_GLM_Keyboard_Input_Handler

I have tried a lot of different ways to handle Keyboard Input but have found that this method (maintaining bools and checking every frame) is the most reliable, which also uses the GLFW libraries.

Also includes mathematics for turning using Quaternians (avoiding Gimbal Lock) using the GLM libraries.
